# Secret-Scanner


This Python program functions as a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool specifically designed to scan files or directories for hardcoded secrets, including API keys, tokens, passwords, and private keys. It utilizes regular expressions (regex) to identify patterns that correspond to common secret formats.
 
The script presents its findings by displaying the following information:
 
- File name
- Line number
- Type of secret detected
- Matching text
 
It has been crafted to be straightforward, readable, and beginner-friendly.
